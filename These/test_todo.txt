Scheduler overhead :
 - Create 1 Million empty tasks and measure performance with OpenMP, TBB, StarPU, kaapi
 - Create 1 Million empty tasks with 2D dependancies and measure performance with OpenMP, TBB, StarPU, kaapi
 - So the same thing with taggre

Granularity :
 - Try each algorithm one-by-one
   - ILU(k) with k = 0,1,2
 - Use the estimated cost in Taggre and match results

NUMA
