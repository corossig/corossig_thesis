\subsection{SMP}
Inside each node of a cluster, one can found several processors.
%
These processors often share all resources of the motherboard, this include IO and memory.
%
The way to interconnect all processors with elements of the motherboard can differ.
%
In SMP architecture, all processors are connected to a data bus and a bus arbiter choose with processor can do a memory access (Fig.~\ref{fig:smp}).
%
This design doesn't scale in performance when the number processor grow up.
%
The bandwidth is shared by all processors and the bus arbiter become a bottleneck.
%
Worst, the latency of a memory access depends on the congestion of the bus.
