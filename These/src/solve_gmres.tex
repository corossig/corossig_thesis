\subsection{GMRES}
GMRES\footnote{Generalized Minimal RESidual} method is an iterative method used to solve system of linear equation.
%
This method doesn't work well with matrices used by reservoir simulator.


  \begin{itemize}
    \item Iterative method for general matrix
    \item Doesn't work well with our matrices
  \end{itemize}
