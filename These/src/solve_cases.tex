\subsection{Reservoir case studies}
To test new threading method, I use a linear solver code developed at Total.
%
We need some test cases to be able to evaluate improvements done in the linear solver.
%
We will use SPE10 test case, this test case is based on data taken from the second model of the 10th SPE test case\cite{SPE10}.
%
It is a reservoir with 1~122~000 cells in a regular Cartesian 3D grid of size 60 x 220 x 85.
%
Other test cases are generated from an internal program.
%
It generates regular Cartesian 3D cube with an arbitrary size.
%
These generated cases allow us to test a lot of combination in size to evaluate the scalability of our algorithm.
