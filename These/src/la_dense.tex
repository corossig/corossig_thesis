\subsection{Dense linear algebra}

When we talk about linear algebra, the first thing that comes in mind is a matrix, and often a dense matrix.
%
To understand the adjective \textem{dense} we need to know it's opposite \textem{sparse}.
%
A sparse matrix is a matrix with a significant part of zero value, it's called sparse because we can only store the non-zero value.
%
So, a dense matrix is just a matrix with a majority of zero value.


Dense Linear Algebra optimization has been studied for a long time\ref{42}.
Most common techniques are cache blocking, SIMD vectorization ans prefetch.
These three techniques are possible because computations of Dense problems
are regular.
