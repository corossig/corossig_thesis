\subsection{Many-core}
Another solution, used by Intel in the Xeon Phi coprocessor, is to use a ring bus (See Fig~\ref{fig:interconnect}).
%
Memory is distributed over the ring bus just as core units.
%
Why is it better than an SMP ?
%
During my thesis, I had the opportunity of trying a Xeon Phi.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Xeon phi
    \item GPU ?
    \item Too many change in program but not always performance (data transfer)
  \end{itemize}
