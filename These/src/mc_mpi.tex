\section{Message passing}
Another way to obtain parallelism on a multi-core architecture is to use a message passing paradigm.
%
In this paradigm, there is no shared memory between all process, but each process has its own memory space.
%
Exchanges between processes are done by transfer of messages.
%
The main advantage of this solution is that with a single program you can hit cluster ant shared memory at once.
%
The disadvantage is that some algorithm can't be write with this paradigm.
