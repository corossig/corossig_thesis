\subsection{Domain decomposition}
If we want to use more than one node of a cluster, we have to divide our problem into pieces.
%
In reservoir simulation, these pieces are called domains and they represented physical parts of the reservoir.
%
Domain decomposition is a method to solve large problem by splitting them into smaller problems.
%
But each domains need to communicate part of their computation in order to solve the complete problem.
%
This method allow us to parallelize the GMRES when we use a distributed memory paradigm like MPI.
%
Each MPI process manages a subset of cells in the reservoir simulation and is able to do MPI communication on border of the domain.
%
However, the ILU preconditioner is sensible to the number of domain, the GMRES convergence is degraded when the number of domain is too high.
