\subsection{Preconditioned GMRES}
A popular approach to solve large sparse linear systems of equation is a Krylov method (like GMRES or Conjugate Gradient) preconditioned by an incomplete factorization (see~\cite{Saad96IMSLS}).
%
This is often the most time consuming part of a numerical simulation.
%
This method can be used with any matrix since the matrix is invertible.
%
The GMRES algorithm is mostly composed of some vectors operations and a SpMV\footnote{sparse matrix-vector product}.

As matrices used in reservoir simulation are not well conditioned, the GMRES algorithm converge after a lot of iterations.
%
In this case, we need to precondition the matrix to make the GMRES converges faster.
%
A good preconditioner for our matrices is ILU\footnote{Incomplete LU factorization}.
%
In this method there is two major operations, the first step is the {\em ILU matrix factorization} and the second step is the {\em triangular solve}.
%
LU factorization consists of factorizing a matrix $A$ into two triangular matrices $L$ and $U$.
%
Then to solve $Ax=b$ is the same as solving $Ly=b$ and $U.x=y$, which can be do easily because $L$ and $U$ are triangular matrices.
%
In case of sparse linear problems, the sparse matrix $A$ become too dense, a lot of zero values become non-zero values and the size to store the matrix in memory become too high.
%
To maintain a reasonable among of memory usage, one can only do some part of the factorization, this is called incomplete LU factorization.
%
With ILU we will try to obtain a sparse pattern for $L$ and $U$ as close as possible the sparse pattern of $A$.

There are two ways to apply ILU in GMRES :
\begin{itemize}
  \item Left preconditioning : $A^{-1}(Ax)=b$
  \item Right preconditioning : $A(A^{-1}x)=b$
\end{itemize}

In programming term, this means that the SpMV must be done before or after the TRSV.
