\subsection{Memory explanation}
To understand previous results we need to study a little bit of computer architecture.
%
Performance of a computer mostly depends on two things : processors and memories.
%
When a program wants to read memory, it is subjected to a memory penalty.
%
This penalty is the sum of two constraints :
\begin{itemize}
        \item latency : the time between the ask of a memory of the first byte received;
        \item bandwith : the maximum of byte per second that can be send/receive
\end{itemize}
%
In a modern computer, there is different type of memories.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Define memory penalty
    \item Talk about bandwidth
  \end{itemize}
