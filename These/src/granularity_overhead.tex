\subsection{Parallelism vs overhead}
A task-based runtime need to dispatch tasks all over the available computational cores.
%
But this action isn't completely free, some operations need to be done by the scheduler and depends on its implementation.
%
Generally more the runtime is complex, more it will spend time to dispatch tasks.
%
A very simple runtime could be composed of a shared queue, in which tasks are inserted when a core can execute them.
%
This queue must be thread safe since every thread will enqueue/dequeue tasks at the same time.
%
Unfortunately, even this runtime have an overhead when it enqueue/dequeue a task.
%
This overhead can be negligible if the time spend in the task is much higher than the overhead.


Even a static scheduler has overhead, since all tasks are distributed over all cores, the scheduler need to check if all dependencies of the task are satisfied.
%
This could be do more or less efficiently but in all case we lost the dynamic load balancing aspect of a dynamic scheduler.
