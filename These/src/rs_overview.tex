\subsection{Overview}

%
Into the depth of the Earth, petroleum and natural gas are trapped.
%
These sources of energy are the result of the transformation of organic matter coming from vegetables and dead animals under very high constraint during millions of years.
%
Hardly hide under several kilometers of stone, petroleum companies, as Total S.A., tried to find them all, before a concurrent company.



More generally, we call reservoir of hydrocarbon, or shorter just reservoir, a major concentration of petroleum and/or natural gas under the ground.
%
The first step to find a reservoir is to analyze the underground with seismic waves.
%
These waves are generated by bomb for under sea analysis or with seismic truck for the surface of the Earth.
%
When these seismic waves are analyzed with some waves equation modeling software, petroleum companies can obtain a pretty good representation of the underground.
%
When a reservoir is found, one of the first questions is : "Does it pay to exploit this reservoir ?".
%
Reservoir simulations help to answer this question.
%
By doing a flow of fluid simulation through porous media, petroleum companies can obtain an approximation of the among of possible oil recovering.
%
If it is profitable to exploit the reservoir, petroleum companies can start exploiting the reservoir.



But it is not sufficient to dig and wait for petroleum sprung in a geyser form like we can see in animated cartoon.
%
Petroleum companies need to install some wells.
%
There are two major kinds of wells (Fig .\ref{fig:wells}) :
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item Injector wells, this is the wells which will increase pressure inside the reservoir by injecting matter (water, polymer, ..).
  \item Production wells, this is the wells which will recovery oil, they are also essential to control pressure by producing more or less oil.
\end{itemize}

Reservoir engineers need to find the optimal number of wells and also their optimal placement.
%
Again, they use reservoir simulations to test different configurations.
%
Later, when the petroleum company starts exploiting the field, it can be interesting to forecast oil production.
%
Once again, reservoir simulation helps (Fig. \ref{fig:floviz}).

As shown previously, reservoir simulation is a key step in the oil recovery process.
%
Petroleum companies want to simulate more and more precisely internal state of a reservoir, and of course as quickly as possible.
%
Let's see the structure of a reservoir simulator.
