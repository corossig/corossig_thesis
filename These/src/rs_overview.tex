Into the depth of the Earth, petroleum and natural gaz are trapped.
%
These sources of energy are the result of the transformation of organic matter coming from vegetables and dead animals under very high contraint during millions of years.
%
Hardly hide under several kilometers of stone, petroleum companies as Total tried to find them all, before a concurrent company. 
%
More generaly, we call reservoir of hydrocarbure, or shorter just reservoir, a major concentration of petroleum and/or natural gaz.
%
The first step to find a reservoir is to analyze the underground with seismic waves.
%
These waves are generated by bomb for under sea analysis or with seismic truck for Earth's surface.
%
When these seismic waves are anylized with waves equation modeling software, petroleum companies can obtain a pretty good model of the underground.
%
If a reservoir is found, one of the first questions is : "Does it pay to exploit this reservoir ?"
%
Reservoir simulations help to answer this question.
%
By doing a flow of fluid simulation throught porous media, petroleum companies can obtain an approximation of the among of possible oil recovering.
%
If it is profitable to exploit the reserveoir, petroleum companies can start exploiting the reservoir.
%
But it is not suffisant to dig and wait for petroleum sprung in a geyser form like we can see in animated cartoon.
%
Petroleum companies need to install some wells.
%
There are two major kinds of wells :
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item Producer wells,
  \item Injector wells,
\end{itemize}
%
Reservoir engineers need to find the optimal number of wells and also their optimal placement.
%
Again, they use reservoir simulations to test different configurations.

Later, when the pretroleum company start expoiting the field, it can be interresting to forecast oil production.
%
Once again, reservoir simulation helps.


As show previously, reservoir simulation is a key step in the oil recovery process.
%
Petroleum companies want to simulate bigger reservoir as quickly as possible.
