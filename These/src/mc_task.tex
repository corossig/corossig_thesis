\subsection{Task paradigm}
Task paradigm can used to describe a set of computational part with strict order between some part.
%
It is usually represented under a DAG\footnote{Direct Acyclic Graph} form, nodes are computational part and edges are dependencies between nodes.
%
This representation describe naturally the parallelism of a problem.
%
This graph is then used by a task scheduler which will choice to affect a specific task to a core.
