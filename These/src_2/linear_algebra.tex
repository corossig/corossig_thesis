\section{Linear algebra}

Linear Algebra problems can be classified into two types.
On one side we have dense problems.
These problems are numerically stable but need to be small,
around ten hundred unknowns because of memory and computation limitations.
On the other side we have sparse problems which can handle billions of unknowns
but they have numerical problems.
