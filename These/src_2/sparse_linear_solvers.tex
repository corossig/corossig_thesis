\section{Sparse linear solvers}
In most of numerical simulation, we need to resolve large systems of linear equations.
%
These systems can be present in the form of a matrix.
%
In this matrix form, we obtain an equation $Ax=b$ where A is a sparse matrix,
x is a vector of unknowns we want to find and b is a vector of constant terms.
%
The sparsity of A will depend on the physical problem we want to solve.
%
For example, if we want to simulate a very simple car.
%
The figure \ref{car_matrix} represent connection between all pieces of our simple car.
