\subsection{GMRES}
GMRES\footnote{Generalized Minimal RESidual} method is an iterative method used to solve system of linear equation.
%
This method can be used with any matrix since the matrix is invertible.
%
The GMRES algorithm is composed of some vectors operations and a sparse matrix-vector product.
%
Without preconditioner, GMRES doesn't work well with matrices used by reservoir simulator.
