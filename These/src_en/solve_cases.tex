\subsection{Reservoir case studies}
To test our new threading method, we use a linear solver code developed by Total S.A. and we try to improve the RAS~\footnote{Restrictive Additive Schartz} part of the code.
%
We need some test cases to be able to evaluate improvements done in the linear solver.
%
We will use SPE10 test case, this test case is based on data taken from the second model of the 10th SPE test case\cite{SPE10}.
%
It is a reservoir with 1~122~000 cells in a regular Cartesian 3D grid of size 60 x 220 x 85, it corresponds to a 7 points discretization of a reference problem from petroleum industry.
%
Other test cases are generated from an internal program and are also obtained from a 7 points discretization scheme (e.g., finite volume).
%
It generates regular Cartesian 3D cube with an arbitrary size.
%
These generated cases allow us to test lot of combinations in size in order to evaluate the scalability of our algorithm.
