\subsection{Cluster}
To be able to do large physical simulations, we need a lot of computational power.
%
This power can be measured in FLOPS\footnote{FLoating-point Operations Per Second}, it is the number of operations per second that a computer can do on decimal numbers.
%
For a long time, large physical simulations are done on computer clusters.
%
Clusters are composed of nodes, similar to a desktop computer, connected by a low latency/high bandwidth network.
%
Each node has its own memory, runs its own OS and can be consider like a desktop computer.
%
The major difficulty to write a program which can
