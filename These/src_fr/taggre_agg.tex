\subsection{Aggregate operators}
We call aggregate operators the different heuristics used by Taggre to coarse a DAG.
%
These heuristics focused on keeping the graph acyclic.
%
We have design 4 heuristics, each heuristic address a problem and never create cycle.
%
To evaluate the benefice of each heuristic, we also have, inside Taggre, a minimal simulator which will estimate the time to schedule the graph.
%
This evaluation is essential to measure the remain parallelism in the DAG.
